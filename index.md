Hello! My name is Samantha Zarate and I am currently a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, working in Mike Schatz's lab. I used to work at DNAnexus as a bioinformatics scientist.

I work in computational genomics and my interests include structural variation and long-read data. Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in collaborating!
