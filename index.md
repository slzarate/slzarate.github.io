Hello! My name is Samantha Zarate and I am currently a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, working in Mike Schatz's lab. Before this, I worked at DNAnexus in Mountain View, CA as a bioinformatics scientist. I graduated from Stanford University in 2016 with a BS in biomedical computation.

I work in computational genomics and my primary interest is structural variation. Please feel free to get in touch if you are interested in collaborating!
